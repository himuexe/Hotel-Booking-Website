# üîß GitHub Actions Troubleshooting Guide

> **Quick fixes for common GitHub Actions issues in the Vacays project**

## üö® CodeQL/SARIF Upload Error

### Problem
```
Error: Resource not accessible by integration - https://docs.github.com/rest
Warning: Resource not accessible by integration
```

### Root Cause
The `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3` action requires specific permissions to upload security scan results to GitHub's Code Scanning feature.

### ‚úÖ Solution Applied

**1. Added Required Permissions**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write  # Required for SARIF uploads
  actions: read
```

**2. Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added `continue-on-error: true` to prevent workflow failure
- Added fallback artifact upload for scan results
- Added category labels for better organization

**3. Improved Security Scanning**
- Separate JSON and SARIF outputs
- Better error handling and reporting
- Artifact backup for all scan results

### üîç How to Verify the Fix

1. **Check Workflow Permissions**
   ```bash
   # Your workflows now have proper permissions
   cat .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml | grep -A 5 "permissions:"
   ```

2. **Enable Code Scanning (if needed)**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Code security and analysis**
   - Enable **Code scanning** if not already enabled

3. **Test the Workflow**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Add security-events permissions for CodeQL"
   git push origin main
   ```

### üìä Expected Results

After the fix:
- ‚úÖ Security scans run without permission errors
- ‚úÖ SARIF results upload to GitHub Security tab
- ‚úÖ Fallback artifacts available if upload fails
- ‚úÖ Workflow continues even if SARIF upload fails

## üõ†Ô∏è Other Common GitHub Actions Issues

### Issue: Docker Registry 403 Forbidden

**Problem**: Docker push fails with permission error
```
ERROR: failed to push ghcr.io/username/repo:tag: unexpected status from POST request: 403 Forbidden
```

**Root Cause**: Missing `packages: write` permission for GitHub Container Registry

**‚úÖ Solution**:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: write  # Required for pushing to GHCR
  security-events: write

jobs:
  build:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write  # Also add to specific job
```

**Additional Steps**:
1. **Enable Package Registry** (if needed):
   - Go to repository **Settings** ‚Üí **Actions** ‚Üí **General**
   - Under "Workflow permissions", ensure "Read and write permissions" is selected

2. **Verify Registry URL**:
   ```yaml
   env:
     REGISTRY: ghcr.io
     IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}  # Should be lowercase
   ```

3. **Check Repository Visibility**:
   - Private repos: Ensure GITHUB_TOKEN has package permissions
   - Public repos: May need to enable package inheritance

4. **Alternative: Use Docker Hub** (if GHCR issues persist):
   ```yaml
   env:
     REGISTRY: docker.io
     IMAGE_NAME: your-dockerhub-username/hotel-booking-website
   
   - name: Log in to Docker Hub
     uses: docker/login-action@v3
     with:
       username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
       password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

5. **Test Registry Access**:
   ```bash
   # Test locally with GitHub token
   echo ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} | docker login ghcr.io -u ${{ github.actor }} --password-stdin
   ```

### Issue: Docker Build Failures

**Problem**: Docker builds fail with context errors
```yaml
# Fix: Ensure correct build context
- name: Build Docker image
  run: |
    docker build -t myapp:latest ./frontend  # Correct context
```

### Issue: Node.js Cache Misses

**Problem**: Dependencies reinstall every time
```yaml
# Fix: Proper cache configuration
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    cache: 'npm'
    cache-dependency-path: frontend/package-lock.json  # Specific path
```

### Issue: Artifact Upload Failures

**Problem**: Artifacts not found or too large
```yaml
# Fix: Check paths and add retention
- name: Upload artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: build-results
    path: |
      dist/
      build/
    retention-days: 7  # Manage storage
    if-no-files-found: warn  # Don't fail if missing
```

## üîê Security Best Practices

### 1. Minimal Permissions
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read          # Read repository contents
  security-events: write  # Upload security scan results
  actions: read          # Read workflow information
  # Don't add unnecessary permissions
```

### 2. Secret Management
```yaml
env:
  # Use secrets for sensitive data
  API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
  # Never hardcode secrets in workflows
```

### 3. Error Handling
```yaml
- name: Security scan
  run: npm audit
  continue-on-error: true  # Don't fail entire workflow
```

## üìû Getting Help

### üîç Debugging Steps

1. **Check Workflow Logs**
   - Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
   - Click on the failed workflow run
   - Expand the failing step to see detailed logs

2. **Verify Permissions**
   ```bash
   # Check if your repository has required features enabled
   # Settings ‚Üí Code security and analysis
   ```

3. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   # Test Docker builds locally
   docker build -t test ./frontend
   
   # Test security scans locally
   npx audit-ci --moderate
   ```
